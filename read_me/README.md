**BeatBox Project**
# By Nathan Trautenberg

# Purpose
This project creates a linked list of sounds. Different sounds can be appended, prepended, and removed from the list. The sounds can be played by the terminal at dynamic rates and with customizable voices. It's a "BeatBox" of sorts.

# Demonstration
This project demonstrates:
- My ability to write tests
- Use TDD practice to create and troubleshoot the desired interaction pattern
- use appropriate methods, enumerables, and logic to solve problems
- understand scope (such as to instantiate objects in another class with attributes available on the current instance)
- Not give up (lol)

# Reflection
`I struggled most in the last third of iteration 1 all the way through iteration 2. I believe that my logic is solid; I knew what I wanted to do with the code but I didn't know HOW to code the code. Frequently, I resorted to scouring the internet and videos on linked lists, but many of the resources had syntax I wasn't comfortable with. I ended up blending my own code with what I read/saw in much of iteration 2. That being said, I was very proud to be able to set up iteration 1 and, with help from the instructor to setup the class in iteration 3 and help from a classmate on one particular problem in iteration 4, solve the rest with only minimal help from the internet.`

```{Looking forward, I will need to continue to draw pictures of what I want my code to do (this was helpful for me to visualize the pieces/logic I need to pass tests). In addition, I've been pseudocoding mostly in my head, but I need to get in a better habit of writing it all down in vscode so I don't forget any steps. Finally, I need to git add and git commit on a more regular basis.}```
